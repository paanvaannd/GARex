# GARex
####Javascript-based genetic algorithm injected into T-rex Jump game.

*Forked from JoeyVinyard's NeuralTrex project.*

Joey's genetic algorithm (GA) was calibrated to optimize each T-rex's jump time with relation to the T-rex's velocity. A hard-coded mutation rate of 0.02 was selected and hard-coded into the initial iteration of the project. My iteration will be optimizing the actual algorithm used in the initial iteration of this project by seeing which mutation value generates optimal T-rex progeny in the shortest span on average.

I will include other tweaks and optimization informaiton as the project progresses.
